# BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-MODELING-USING-ALTERYX
Problem Statement: - 
Whether the hotel customer will redeem the yearly subscription or not ?
I have used Alteryx to develop Logistic Regression, Step wise Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Model to predict binary outcomes by analyzing the outcomeâ€™s relationship with one or more predictor variables.
Before starting applying the algorithms on the given hotel loyalty data set, I have created the estimation and validation sample.
